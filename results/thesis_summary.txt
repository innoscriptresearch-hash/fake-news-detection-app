THESIS RESULTS SUMMARY

RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION:
Our research demonstrates that multimodal integration of contextual metadata with
advanced transformer architectures significantly improves fake news detection
performance on the challenging LIAR dataset.

KEY FINDINGS:

1. PERFORMANCE BREAKTHROUGH:
   • Previous SOTA (Rout et al., 2025): 0.5956 accuracy
   • Our DeBERTa-v3-base + Multimodal: 0.6511 accuracy
   • Absolute Improvement: +0.0555
   • Relative Improvement: +9.33%

2. METHODOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT:
   • Approach: Text + Metadata multimodal fusion
   • Architecture: DeBERTa-v3-base with attention-based feature integration
   • Training: 10 epochs with stable convergence

3. COMPREHENSIVE PERFORMANCE:
   • Precision: 0.6229
   • Recall: 0.6275
   • F1-Score: 0.6215

CONCLUSION:
Our multimodal approach successfully addresses the limitations of text-only methods,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on the LIAR dataset with a 9.3%
improvement over existing approaches.
